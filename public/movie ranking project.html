<h1>All The Reasons Why Penny Loves Daniel</h1>
<h2>There are so many reasons, but here are the top 5.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Daniel is the most caring and sweet person Penny has ever met!</h3>
<p>Self explanatory reason, tbh. Penny has never met someone who cares about her more than she cares about herself. Every word Daniel speaks to Penny is sweet like honey, Penny can almost taste it!</p>
<h3>2. Daniel is the most handsome boy on this planet.</h3>
<p>Ever since the first time Penny saw Daniel, she always thought that Daniel was so handsome and cute. She still thinks so and will always think so forever and ever!</p>
<h3>3. Daniel is Penny's safe place.</h3>
<p>Whenever Penny is feeling sad or upset, Daniel knows exactly the right way to make her feel better. Whether that is by giving her a big hug, a kiss, or just hearing her out, Daniel always manages to make Penny feel safe and heard. Penny is so grateful for Daniel.</p>
<h3>4. Daniel loves Penny's family just like his own.</h3>
<p>Penny loves how Daniel is so close with Penny's mama. It is just so precious to see the most special people in Penny's life get along so well! Penny hopes that Daniel and Seho can become closer in the future. Penny loves Daniel's family just as much. She misses them a whole lot!</p>
<h3>5. Even through ups and downs, Penny knows Daniel is always going to be there for her.</h5>
<p>Arguing and fighting is completely normal in a relationship! It is how you solve through those conflicts that really matter. Even though Penny can become quite petty and maybe a little mean sometimes, she always feels bad whenever Daniel comforts her. She wishes she had apologized a bit earlier :(</p>
